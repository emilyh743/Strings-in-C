# Strings-in-C

Computer Organizatons course assignment.

ex1.c

Program implements bubble sort of strings. 

Program implements the primary data structure as a 2-dimensional array Strings[NUM][LEN], where NUM is the number of strings, and LEN is the maximum length allowed for the string: the first index i gives you the i-th string, and the second index j gives you the j-th character within that string.

ex2.c

Same as ex1.c, however, C string library functions are used instead to simplify bubble sort.
